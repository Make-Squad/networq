## What is networq?

Networq is an online place to help you remember the people you have met. We store connections to new contacts and the business card information they have shared with you.

Store your business card onlien! You can store phone numbers and emails given to you by business partners, acquaintances and friends. We are implementing face recognition to allow easy use and other options for access as well.
